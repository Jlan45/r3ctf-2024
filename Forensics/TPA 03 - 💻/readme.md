As a low-level employee of R3 Inc., you received a suspicious file on the internal IM on the eve of the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. After you clicked on it, you realized that your computer might have been hacked by the red team. As a computer geek, you quickly opened the wire shark to start emergency response and performed some electronic evidence forensics that you thought was useful. But it seems a little too late.

Could u found what's hacker is doing in your pc?
