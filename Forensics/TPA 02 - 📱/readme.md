Peggy is an employee at a company and, like many others, occasionally uses her personal mobile phone for work-related tasks. Unfortunately, she has become the target of a phishing attack. Your task is to uncover the details of this attack by finding the attacker's phone number and Peggy's password.

Submit your findings in the format `r3ctf{number_password}`. For the phone number, remove any symbols and spaces. For example, if the attacker's phone number is `+1 123-456-7890` and the password Peggy entered is `passwd`, your flag should be `r3ctf{11234567890_passwd}`.
