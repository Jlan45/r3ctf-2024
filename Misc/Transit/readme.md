**This is an OSINT chal!** The city's rail transit is like the veins of time, glides effortlessly through the concrete jungle, transforming every journey into a flowing tapestry. So which station is this?

The flag format is `R3CTF{city_lowercase_name_endswith_station}`. For example [the Huixin Xijie Nankou station of the Beijing Subway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huixin_Xijie_Nankou_station) would be `R3CTF{beijing_huixin_xijie_nankou_station}`.
