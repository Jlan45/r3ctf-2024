Ben is a superpower who loves playing hide and seek. He can teleport to anywhere to no one can find him, but he seems unaware that his ability only works within a certain range 

Rules: 
1. The adorable Ben will only appear within the range of `(0, -50, 0)` to `(128, 50, 128)`. 
2. Ben will every 10 seconds and reappear in a new location after 10 seconds. 
3. A "newtp" has been added for all players to teleport to any coordinates.
