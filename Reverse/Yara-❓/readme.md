crazyman is a malware analyst and we found this strange file called `rules` on his computer and `README.md` that says:
```
❯ yr scan -C rules flag.txt
Congratulations! You have found the flag!
FindFlag flag.txt
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 1 file(s) scanned in 0.1s. 1 file(s) matched.
```
Can you help us find the contents of flag.txt, which could be important to us?
