**Note:** Flag is in `/var/jb/var/root/flag` with `-r--------  1 root   wheel`. We have configured the sandbox profile so the two services in the attachment are reachable within the iOS sandbox. 

>We use an iPhone 8 with iOS 16.7.1 for this challenge.   
We highly recommend you test your exploitation on jailbroken devices or Corellium or any emulators like t8030-qemu / D22-QEMU first.   
**Free feel to ask admin for temporary Corellium access in case you need.**
