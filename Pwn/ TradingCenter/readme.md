Welcome to the Ransomware Decryptor Trading Center, where you can buy what you want, but only if you have the money.

And I have opened some confidential files in the file manager and listed the process IDs of the files and manager in the help document. If you need them, please contact the administrator to purchase.

I'll give you a chance to get more money. Do you dare to gamble with me?

WARNING: The file manager will automatically close after **60s**, please be mindful of the time.

**You do not need to activate the dynamic target machine; simply connect to the remote target machine and use the token as your credential.ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡**
